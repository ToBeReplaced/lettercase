# lettercase

Nothing to see here yet!

Similar to [camel-snake-kebab].

The aim is to create a declarative, simple API for manipulating the case convention of keywords, symbols, and strings.

This solves the problem of manipulating case when communicating between different technologies.  For example, converting your lisp-cased keywords into snake_cased strings for your relational database.

## TODO

- Create base conventions.
- Create PEP8 namespace for an example of converting to PEP8.
