# lettercase

The aim is to create a declarative, simple API for manipulating the case convention of keywords, symbols, and strings.

This solves the problem of manipulating case when communicating between different technologies. For example, converting your lisp-cased keywords into lowercase strings separated by underscores for your relational database.

This project is similar to [camel-snake-kebab]. It differs in a few primary areas:

- It does not enable or allow implicit conversion between named types.
- It is extensible.
- It does not intend to support clojurescript.

## Supported Clojure Versions

lettercase is tested on Clojure 1.5.1 only. It may work on other Clojure versions.

## Maturity

This is production-ready software.

## Installation

lettercase is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars]:
```clojure
[org.tobereplaced/lettercase "1.0.0"]
```
lettercase follows [Semantic Versioning]. Please note that this means the public API for this library is considered stable, and any breaking changes must occur after a 2.0.0 release.

## Documentation

The [Codox API Documentation] is extensive and is the best way of understanding the library. If you are looking for a quick example:

```clojure
(ns lettercase-usage
    (:require [org.tobereplaced.lettercase :refer [lower-hyphen-keyword]]))

(lower-hyphen-keyword "Foo the BAR")
;; :foo-the-bar
```

## Support

Please post any comments, concerns, or issues to the Github issues page. I welcome any and all feedback. If you have a use-case that is not currently supported, but that you believe belongs in this library, let me know!
